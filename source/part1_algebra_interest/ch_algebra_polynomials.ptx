<introduction>
	<p>
		In the previous sections, we have discussed the mathematics of lines, and applications to item price and total cost functions.  
		But linear functions are not powerful enough to model other important concepts, such as <em>revenue</em> and <em>profit</em>.
		Before we introduce these concepts, we first breifly review quadratic and polynoimal functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The concepts in this and the previous chapter are inter-related in complex ways.  The following diagram summarizes the relationships between the main concepts in this section and the preceeding section.  Refer back to this diagram from time to time to help organize your thoughts.

	<p>
		Most quadratics that we see in this course will pass through the <m>x-axis</m>.  In this case, there are two ways to find the vertex of a quadratic.  One is easier to remember, and one is easier to use. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice that <em>quadratic</em> functions have a perfect reflection symmetry through the vertex <m>(h,k)</m>. 
		That means that the vertex is <em>half way between</em> the two roots, or equivalently the vertice's <m>x</m>-value <m>h</m> is the <em>average of the roots</em> of the function (if they exist).
	</p>
	<p>
		That means you can find the <m>x</m>-value of a vertex, denoted <m>h</m>, by first finding the roots (using the quadratic equation), and then by averaging them. 
		To find the <m>y</m>-value of the vertex, plug <m>h</m> into the equation for the quadratic.  In other words, <m>k=f(h)</m>.
	</p>


	<p>
		There is also a shortcut for finding the <m>x</m>-value of a vertex.  
	</p>
	
	<proposition xml:id="prop-quadraticvertex">
		<statement>
			<p>	
				Suppose that <m>f(x)=ax^2+ bx + c</m> is a quadratic function.  Then the vertex is located at the point <m>(h,k)</m> with <m>x</m>-value <m>h=\dfrac{-b}{2a}</m> is the average of the <m>x</m>-intercepts, and <m>y</m>-value <m>k = f(h)</m>, which is equal to <m>k=c-\dfrac{b^2}{4a}</m>.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<proof>
			<p>	
				We have already noticed that <m>h</m> is the average of the roots by the symmetry of the quadratic function.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recall also that the <em>roots</em> of the function <m>f(x)=ax^2+ bx + c</m> are <me>x_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}= \dfrac{-b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} </me> and <me>x_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}= \dfrac{-b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} </me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the average of those roots, simply compute
				<md>
					<mrow> h  \amp =  \frac{1}{2} (x_1 + x_2) </mrow>
					<mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2} \left( \dfrac{-b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} + \dfrac{-b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right)  </mrow>
					<mrow>  \amp = \frac{1}{2} \left( \dfrac{-b}{2a}  + \dfrac{-b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right)  </mrow>
					<mrow>  \amp = \frac{1}{2} \left( \dfrac{-b}{2a}  + \dfrac{-b}{2a} + 0 \right)</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2} \left( \dfrac{-2b}{2a}\right)</mrow>
					<mrow> h \amp = \frac{-b}{2a}</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the <m>y</m>-value of the vertex, simply plug <m>h=\frac{-b}{2a}</m> into the original function <m>f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c</m>.  That gives 
				<md>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Let <m>f(x)=-x^2 + 3x -2 </m>.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
				Solve <m> f(x) =0</m>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					We must solve the equation <m>-x^2 + 3x -2 = 0</m>.  
					We can do this by factoring, or by using the quadratic equation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the quadratic equation <m>x = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2 - 4\cdot (-1) \cdot (-2)}}{2\cdot(-1)}</m>, we get that <m>x=1</m> or <m>x=2</m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will evenutally need to solve equations by factoring, so this is a good time to start practicing.  We will rewrite the equation
					<me>
						-x^2 + 3x -2 = 0 
					</me>.
					It is easiest to factor when the leading term is just  <m>x^2</m>.  Here, the leading coefficient is <m>-1</m>, so we should divide each term on the left by <m>-1</m>.  
					<me>
						(-1)\cdot \Big(\frac{-1}{-1}x^2 + \frac{3}{-1}x -\frac{2}{-1}\Big) = 0 
					</me>
					Essentially, we are "un-distributing" the leading term of <m>-1</m>.  Simplifying the equation down, we now get 
					<me>
						(-1)\cdot \Big(x^2 -3 x +2 \Big) = 0 
					</me>
					Now we can factor the quadratic inside.  We want to find some numbers <m>d_1,d_2</m> such that <me>x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x+d_1)(x+d_2) = x^2 + (d_1+d_2)x + d_1\cdot d_2</me>.  In other words, we want numbers that add to <m>-3</m> and multiply to positive <m>2</m>.  Trying <m>d_1=-1</m> and <m>d_2=-2</m>, we get <m>-1+-2=-3</m> and <m>(-1)(-2)=2</m> as desired.  That means we can rewrite our original equation as 
					<me>
						(-1)\cdot \Big(x-1\Big)\Big(x-2\Big) = 0 
					</me>
					But the product of two numbers can only equal zero if the individual numbers are zero.  That means that the equation is equivalent to <em>either</em> having <m>x-1=0</m> <em>or</em> having <m>x-2=0</m>.  
				</p>
				<p>
					In other words, this is equivalent to having <m>x=1</m> or <m>x=2</m>, which are the two <m>x</m>-intercepts of our quadratic.

			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Remember that there  are two ways to find the <m>x</m>-value of the vertex.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Because the vertex is the average of the roots, and because we have already found that the roots are <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=2</m>, the vertex has <m>x</m>-value
					<me>
						h=\dfrac{1+2}{2} = 1.5
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, for <em>quadratics only</em>, we have a nice formula, that <m>h=\dfrac{-b}{2a} = \dfrac{-3}{2\cdot (-1)}= 1.5</m>
				</p>
				<p>
					To find the <m>y</m>-value of the vertex <m>k</m>, just compute <m>k = f(h) </m>

								<li>
									<title>Solving by Factoring</title>
									<p>
										We know that a product <m>a\cdot b= 0</m> if and only if <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>. So to solve the equation
										<me>
											-0.4x^2 + 10x = 0
										</me>
										since we have 0 on the right, we should try factoring the left side. Because both terms have an <m>x</m>, we can factor <m>x</m> out of both terms. 
										<me>
											x\cdot (-0.4x + 10 ) = 0
										</me>

									<p>
										This product can equal zero if and only if <em>either</em> <me>x=0</me> <em>or</em> <me>-0.4x + 10 = 0</me>.

									<p>
										There are two quantities where revenue equals zero.  The first point is <m>x=0</m>

							The revenue function is a quadratic with negative leading coefficient, so it is a parabola that opens down, which goes through the <m>x</m>-axis at the break-even points.  This allows us to create a quick sketch of the function.

			<title>What does the Revenue Function Teach Us?</title>

			<p>
				As soon as you decide on how much you want to sell each item for, and print the price tag, you are locked into that price until you decide to print a new price tag. Because the quantity you sell will change depending on the price you choose, it is important to think through the implications of your choice <term>before</term> you make that decision. In practice, this usually means a multi-step process:
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Do market research to decide how many units you are likely to sell at different item prices.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Use this information to get a function for price as a function of the scenario <m>x</m>. This gives a model of how the price changes depending on which possible scenario you are in.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The revenue for each scenario <m>x</m> is the product of that <m>x</m> by the scenario's item price.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>

			<p>
				You then compare the different values of Revenue <m>R</m>, and select the scenario (possible universe) that works best for you. In this case, the meaning of the change in revenue <m>\Delta R</m> between different values of <m>x</m> is a bit complex. Here, <m>\Delta R</m> represents how much revenue would have changed if you had chosen a different possible universe <m>x</m>, by deciding to sell additional units by lowering the fixed unit cost that everyone pays.
			</p>

			<p>
				In other words, the maximum revenue occurs when increasing the quantity <m>x</m> stops increasing the total revenue and starts decreasing the total revenue, because <m>\Delta R</m> stops being positive and starts being negative. This is an important feature, and we'll come back to this later in the semester.

			<title>Graphs of Changes in Time vs Items</title>

			<p>
				You may have noticed a little bit of a change in how we are thinking about price and revenue versus how we thought about gas prices earlier in the semester. The gas prices <m>G</m> is a function of time, so the change in gas price <m>\Delta G</m> simply measures how much the price has changed between two days. But for price and revenue, the different values of <m>x</m> correspond to different and <em>incompatible</em> scenarios where you imagine selling a different number of units.
			</p>

			<p>
				To see how these fit together, imagine you are running a sequence of experiments where on day 1, you set the price so you sell 1 unit. Then, on day 2, you set the price so you sell 2 units, and so on. In this experiment <m>\Delta R</m> measures the change in revenue as you move between different days, which each correspond to a different scenario (possible universe).
			</p>

			<p>
				Just remember - with revenue your goal isn't the experiment itself. You want to <em>use</em> this thought experiment to find the single scenerio <m>x</m> where you have the best revenue.

			When you read an economics problem, always try to translate it into mathematical language.  For example, suppose that you have been asked to <em>find all quantities where you make a profit</em>. You might think through the question as follows: 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Remember that we use the variable <m>x</m> to represent the <em>quanitity</em> of items sold in any scenerio. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Remember that we write <m>P(x)</m> for the total <em>profit</em> of the scenario. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>Think carefully</em> and realize that you make a profit if and only if <em>the total profit is greater than 0</em>. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						That means the question is asking you to find an equation for the profit function <m>P(x)</m>, and to solve the equation <m>P(x)\gt 0</m>, using the techinques from <xref ref="assemblage-continuous-inequalities"  text="title" />.

		<title>To Round or Not to Round?</title>
		
		<p>
			In the previous example, we found that the break even quantities were  <m>x=0.5857\dots</m> or <m>x=3.4142\dots</m>.  But you cannot sell <m>0.587</m> units, so what does this answer mean practically?
		</p>	
		<p>
			Unfortunately, this depends a lot on the specific context of your specific application.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the simple case of $ profit as a result of <m>x</m> items given above, you will only be able to make a profit by selling <m>x=1</m> items, <m>x=2</m> items, or <m>x=3</m> items, since any integer larger or smaller than these will result in a negative profit. 
		</p>
		<p>
			But the power of mathematics is that the same tools can be used to answer questions in very different contexts.  For example, suppose instead that <m>x</m> was the number of <em>thousands</em> of items sold.  In other words, suppose that <m>P(5)</m> is the profit from selling <em>five thousand</em> items.  In that case, you will break even when you sell <m>x=0.5857\dots</m> <em>thousand</em> items or <m>x=3.4142\dots</m> <em>thousand</em> items.  In that case, you would need to sell between <m>586</m> items and <m>340</m> items to make a proift.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Other applications require even greater precision.  For example, currency exchange rates are often given to at least four decimal places.  But what if you are investing millions of dollars in a foreign currency?  Then the fifth, sixth, etc decimal places will suddenly be more important. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In a <em>mathematics</em> class, we will generally try to keep as much precision as possible.  In any specific <em>application</em>, you should think carefully and consult generally accepted practices related to rounding.
