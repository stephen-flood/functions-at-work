  <title>Logarithms and Solving for Time</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    In the previous section, we used exponential functions to compute the value of compound interest as a function of time.  For example, Investing $100 and 25% interest compounded yearly follows the function 
    <me>
      F = 100\cdot (1.25)^t
    </me>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, you will be given the principal, rate, and frequency of compounding, and you will need to <em>find the amount of time</em> you will have to wait to achieve a certain future balance.  If, in the example above, you want to find the time needed to achieve a balance of $4000, you will need to solve the equation 
    <me>
      4000 = 100\cdot (1.25)^t
    </me>.
    This is equivalent to 
    <me>
      40 = \cdot (1.25)^t
    </me>,
    but now we are stuck, since the <m>t</m> is trapped inside the exponent.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get further, we will need to "undo" our compound interest calculation.
    Mathematically, this means that we will need an <em>inverse</em> function.

    If your function is one-to-one, then flipping the arrows gives you a <em>new</em> function that <em>undoes</em> your original function. 
    That new function is called the <term>inverse</term> of the original function.

  <p>
    In <xref ref="eg_onetoone"/>, the function <m>f</m> has an inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m>, defined by flipping each of the arrows.

      In general, the inverse <m>f^{-1}</m> is <alert>not</alert> the same thing as the reciprocal.  In other words, <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> is <alert>not</alert> <m>\dfrac{1}{f(x)}</m> in general.

    <introduction>

        Let <m>f(x) = 2x+1</m>

          Find an equation for <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, write down the equation <m>y=f(x)</m>.  In this case, 
          <me>
            y = 2x + 1
          </me>
          Next, solve this equation for <m>x</m>.

            <mrow> \frac{1}{2}\amp (y \amp -1)\amp= \amp x \amp  </mrow>
          </md>
          Finally, reverse the roles of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.  This gives the equation 
          <me>
            y = \frac{1}{2} ( x - 1) = 0.5 x -0.5
          </me>
          The equation for our inverse is 
          <me>
            f^{-1}(x) = 0.5 x -0.5
          </me>
          
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use your equation for <m>f^{-1}</m> to evaluate <m>f\Big(f^{-1}(x)\Big)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We are given that <m>\color{blue} f({\color{red} x}) = 2{\color{red} x} + 1</m>.  We have also found that <m>f^{-1}(x) = 0.5x - 0.5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compute <m>{ \color{blue} f\Big({\color{red} f^{-1}(x)}\Big) }</m>, replace every <m>\color{red} x</m> in the equation for <m>\color{blue} f({\color{red} x}) </m> with the equation <m>\color{red} f^{-1}(x) = 0.5x - 0.5</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow> { \color{blue} f\Big({\color{red} f^{-1}(x)}\Big) }= \amp {\color{blue} f\Big( { \color{red} 0.5x - 0.5}\Big)}</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp {\color{blue}  2\cdot \Big({ \color{red} 0.5x - 0.5}\Big) + 1}</mrow>

            <mrow>= \amp 2\cdot 0.5x - 2\cdot 0.5 + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp x - 1 + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>= \amp x</mrow>
          </md>
          We have shown in this case that <m>f\Big(f^{-1}(x)\Big)=x</m>.  
          In other words, we have shown that the function and inverse undo eachother.

  <title>Logarithms Undo Exponentials</title>
  
  <p>
    Our main goal is to use logarithms to solve for time in a compound interest equation.  
    Those equations involve many parts, so we will start with a few slightly simpler questions, in the form of a riddle.
  </p>

  <exploration xml:id="ex_motivatinglogs">
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many times do you need to double the number <m>10</m> to achieve an eight-fold increase?  
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Just start doubling 10, and see what works!
          <md>
            <mrow> 10 \cdot 2 = 20 </mrow>
            <mrow> 10 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 40 </mrow>
            <mrow> 10 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 80 </mrow>
          </md>
          You need to double 10 <em>three times</em> to get from 10 to 80 (an eight-fold increase).
          In other words, 
          <me>
            80 = 10 \cdot 2^3

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Our strategy for the first example works the same here:

          </md>
          You need to double any number <em>three times</em> to get an eight-fold increase.
          This is the same as saying that ,

        <p>
          Our strategy for the first example works the same here:

          </md>
          You need to triple any number <em>four times</em> to get an eighty one-fold increase.
          This is the same as saying that , 
          <me>
            81 =  3^4

  <p>
    <term>Logarithms</term> are functions that answer the riddle "how many times do I need to multiply by a number <m>b</m>" to increase by a given factor. More precisely, we make the following definition.

          When you look at this expression, you <em>see</em> a power, so <em>write</em> down the first law of logarithms <m>\ln\Big( x^r \Big)= r\cdot \ln(x)</m>.  Using the numbers we're given, we obtain

          When you look at this expression, you <em>see</em> that the input is the product <m>10</m> and <m>5^3</m>, so <em>write</em> down the second law of logarithms <m>\ln\Big( x\cdot y \Big)= \ln(x) + \ln(y)</m>.   Applying that in our example, we get

        <p>

  <p>
    <alert>Warning:</alert>
    Note that our three laws of logarithms only apply when the exponential, product, or fraction is <em>inside</em> the logarithm.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you try to divide logarithms, such as in <m> \dfrac{\ln(5)}{\ln(2)}</m>, you will get something very different than our log laws.  
    This is because of the surprising fact that 
    <me>
      \log_b(x) = \dfrac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}
    </me>
    For example, if you divide   <m> \dfrac{\ln(5)}{\ln(2)}</m>, you actually get 
    <m>
      \dfrac{\ln(5)}{\ln(2)} = \log_2(5) = 0.9162\dots
    </m>, which is <alert>not</alert> the same thing as <m>\ln\left(\frac{2}{5}
  \right)=0.4306\dots</m>.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Again, for the remainder of the course, we will almost always restrict our attention to natural logarithms.  
    But this last property is useful in many applications, and may help you remember when you can (and when you can't) perform a simplification using the laws of logarithms.

    We can now use the laws of logarithms to help us solve equations where the variable is in the exponent. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As with everything else in algebra, if we have the equation <m>A = B</m>, we can replace it with the equation <m>\ln(A) = \ln(B)</m>.
  </p>

  <exploration xml:id="ex_solving_exponentials">

          Solve for <m>x</m> satisfying <m>2^{3x} = 5</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The key idea of algebra is that if you have the equation <m>A = B</m>, you can do the same thing to both sides and have another true equation.  
          Here, we are given that 
          <me>2^{3x} = 5</me>
          That means that we also know that the equation <m>\ln(A) = \ln(B)</m> is true, replacing <m>A=2^{3x}</m> and <m>B=5</m>.  This gives
          <me>
            \ln\Big(2^{3x}\Big) = \ln\Big( 5 \Big)
          </me>
          We have the property of logarithms that <m>\ln(x^r) = r\cdot\ln(x)</m> on the left, to get the equation 
          <me>
            3x \cdot \ln\Big(2\Big) = \ln\Big( 5 \Big)
          </me>
          Now, this looks complicated, but we can use a calculator to simplify <m>\ln(2) = 0.693\dots</m> and <m>\ln(5) = 1.609\dots</m>.  This gives us the equation 
          <me>
            3x \cdot 0.693{\dots} = 1.609\dots
          </me>
          Rearranging the left side, we have 
          <me>
            3\cdot 0.693{\dots}\cdot x = 1.609\dots
          </me>
          Using a calculator, we see that <m>3\cdot 0.693\dots = 2.079\dots</m>, which gives 
          <me>
            2.079\dots x = 1.609\dots 
          </me>
          Dividing both sides by <m>2.079\dots</m>, we get 
          <me>
            x = \dfrac{1.609\dots}{2.079\dots} = 0.773\dots
          </me>
          You could also have done this with the original <m>3x \cdot \ln\Big(2\Big) = \ln\Big( 5 \Big)</m> by dividing both sides by <m>3\cdot\ln(2)</m> to get 
          <me>
            x = \dfrac{\ln(5)}{3\cdot \ln(2)}
          </me>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve for <m>x</m> satisfying <m>4\cdot(1.95)^{2x} = 16</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        There are two different approaches for solving an equation like this, planning ahead or using brute force. 
          <dl>
            <li>
              <title>Planning Ahead</title>
              <p>
                We wish to solve the equation 
                <me>4\cdot(1.95)^{2x} = 16</me>
                We want to eventually introduce logarithms to allow us to apply Log Law 3, to pull the <m>2x</m> out of the exponent. 
                However, that law will not apply to <m>4\cdot (1.95)^{2x}</m> because of the coefficient of <m>4</m>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                But we can divide both sides of the equation by 4.  This gives us 
                <md>
                  <mrow> \amp 4\cdot (1.95)^{2x} \amp = \amp 16 \amp </mrow>
                  <mrow> \times\frac{1}{4} \amp \amp\amp \amp \times\frac{1}{4} </mrow>
                  <mrow> \amp (1.95)^{2x} \amp = \amp 4 \amp </mrow>
                </md>  
                Now, we can take the logarithm of both sides 
                <me>
                  \ln\Big( {\color{red}(1.95)}^{\color{blue}2x} \Big) = \ln\Big( 4 \Big)
                </me>
                Now we can apply the law of logs <m>\ln({\color{red}x}^{\color{blue}r})= {\color{blue}r}\ln({\color{red}x})</m> on the left with <m>\color{red} x = 1.95</m> and <m>\color{blue} r = 2x</m>
                <me>
                  {\color{blue} 2x} \cdot \ln\Big({\color{red} 1.95}\Big) = \ln\Big(4\Big)
                </me>
                We can now divide both sides by <m>2\cdot \ln(1.95)</m> to get 
                <me>
                  x = \dfrac{\ln\Big(4\Big)}{2\ln\Big(1.95\Big)}
                </me>
                This example is exact, but it can be a bit overwhelming.  You can also use your calculator to simplify 
                <md>
                  <mrow> 2x \cdot \ln\Big(1.95\Big) \amp = \ln\Big(4\Big) </mrow>
                  <mrow> </mrow>
                  <mrow> 2x \cdot 0.667\dots \amp = 1.386\dots </mrow>
                  <mrow> </mrow>
                  <mrow> x\cdot 1.335\dots  \amp = 1.386\dots</mrow>
                  <mrow> </mrow>
                  <mrow>x \amp = \dfrac{1.386\dots}{1.335\dots} = 1.038\dots</mrow>
                </md>

                If you do use your calculator, try to use as many decimal places as possible.  Rounding errors can grow if you do a lot of calculations.  It is possible to understand how these errors grow, but that question is beyond the scope of this course. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Brute Force</title>
              <p>
                We have seen how to solve this equation with a bit of planning ahead.  But what happens if you <em>start</em> by taking the natural log of both sides of the quation
                <me>4\cdot(1.95)^{2x} = 16</me>
                You get 
                <me>
                  \ln\Big( {\color{red} 4}\cdot{\color{blue} (1.95)^{2x}} \Big) = \ln\Big(16\Big)
                </me>
                On the left side, we have <m>\ln\Big( {\color{red} 4}\cdot{\color{blue} (1.95)^{2x}} \Big)</m>.  We <em>cannot</em> use Log Law 1, since this is a product.  Instead, we need to use Log Law 2 <m>\ln({\color{red} a}\cdot {\color{blue} b}) = \ln({\color{red} a}) + \ln({\color{blue} b})</m> with <m>\color{red} a=4</m> and <m>\color{blue} b=(1.95)^{2x}</m>.  This gives 
                <me>
                  \ln\Big( {\color{red} 4}\Big) + \ln\Big({\color{blue} (1.95)^{2x}} \Big) = \ln\Big(16\Big)
                </me>
                Now we can use Law Log 1 <m>\ln(a^r) = r\cdot \ln(a)</m> with <m>a=1.95</m> and <m>r=2x</m> to get 
                <me>

                You can simplify this using a calculator to get

                  {1.386\dots} + 2\cdot x\cdot 0.667\dots = 2.772\dots
                </me>
                You can solve this as usual to get

                Alternatively, you can solve the exact equation to get

          The balance of a certain investment is given by <m>F(t) = 10\cdot 2^t</m> as a function of the number of years <m>t</m>.  
          How long must you wait until the balance reaches 80?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that <em>this specific function</em> is very simple, so it is possible to answer this numerically.  After one year, the balance will be <m>F(1) = 20</m>, after two years the balance will be <m>F(2)=40</m>, and after three years the balance will be <m>F(3)=80</m>.   It will take 3 years for the balance to reach <m>80</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more complex equations, we will need to set up and solve an exponential equation.  In this case, we want to find a <m>t</m> such that <m>F(t) = 10 \cdot 2^t</m> equals 80.
          This gives us the equation

            <mrow> 80 \amp=\amp 10 \cdot 2^t \amp </mrow>

          Alternatively, we could have simplified the natural log terms and solved as follows
          <md>
            <mrow> \ln\Big(8\Big) = t\cdot \ln\Big(2\Big) </mrow>

          Furthermore, we want the <em>future value</em>to be twice 1000.  In other words, we want <m>F=2000</m>
          This gives

          Dividing both sides by 1000 gives

    <title>Depreciating Assets and Scrap Value</title>
    
    <p>
      In this class, our focus is on the mathematical tools that underly economics, business, and accounting.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In accounting, you will learn about how to decide which mathematical too to use (straight line versus declining balance depreciation), and to find a numerical value for the rate of depreciation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rates of depreciation can be found in many ways.  
      For example, you can use the actual sales price for cars based on their mileage to emperically determine how much the value drops per mile. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are also other ways of calculating the rate of depreciation. 
      For example, some assets have a known or conventional "scrap value" and "expected lifespan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you know the starting value, the scrap value, and the expected lifespan, you can actually compute the yearly depreciation you should use.  
      Mathematically, that means solving 
      <me>
        F = P ( 1- r)^t
      </me>
      for the rate <m>r</m> to get 
      <me>
        r = 1- \sqrt[t]{\frac{F}{P}}
      </me>

  <title>Applications of Logarithms</title>
  
  <p>
    Although logarithms are less familiar than lines, polynomials, and rational functions, they do play an important role in the physical and economic sciences.  In this section we will introduce two examples of logarithms.
    These examples are somewhat simplified for mathematical clarity, but the interested reader is encouraged to continue their study to understand the relevant nuances. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Logarithmic models often arise when discussing quantities that are more meaningful when compared to a baseline than when viewed as isolated numbers. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, it is hard to say how happy it would make someone to win a $1000 prize.  
    Presumably this win would make someone with $5,000 in their bank account would be much happier than a similar win would make someone with $5,000,000 in wealth.

    <title>Utility and Logarithms</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Some economists argue that the <em>percieved value of money</em> (often called the <em>utility</em> of money) is logarithmic. 
        Of course, different people will have different utility functions. 
        To see why, we will explore a specific utility function.
      </p>

        <p>
          You can find more on this in Chapter 25 of <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>.
          <!--TODO look up and incorporate "Prospect Theory", Feckner, Bernoulli (cited by Thinking Fast and Slow) -->

          The first thing to note is that <m>U(0)</m> is undefined.  Mathematically, this is because <m>\ln(0)</m> is undefined.  Practically, this is because you would be <em>very</em> unhappy if you did not have any money to use to pay rent, buy food, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, note that this person has negative utility until approximately <m>x=1,000</m>.  Perhaps this would mean that the individual needs at least $1000 for basic necessities.  Then a balance of less than $1000 implies unmet necesseties, which would make the individual unhappy indeed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, consider the values above $1000.  Note that increasing the balance by a factor of 10 <em>approximately</em> increases their happiness by 50 utility points. 
          Often, this is because the individual will start with a list of very clear and very productive uses of the money.  As those clear producive uses are taken care of, the individual needs to look for less clear or less productive uses for their money.  Thus, each dollar does not have the same value to the individual!
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this is an overly simplified example.  In fact, utility functions are much more complex.  But even these more complex functions will share many of the above properties with our logarithmic utility.
