	<title>Lines and Linear Functions</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
		Linear functions show up everywhere, and have very nice mathematical properties.  In this section we will begin by briefly reviewing the basic properties of lines. But our main focus will be on introducing and understanding a number of important applications of linear functions to topics in economic and business contexts.

			<alert>Important:</alert> there are is only <em>one</em> independent variable, <m>x</m> in the right hand side of the point slope form.

			<me>
			y = {\color{green} m} (x - { \color{green} x_1}) + {\color{green} y_1}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Whenever you are asked for the <em>equation for a line</em>, you just need to find <em>numerical values</em> for the slope <m>m</m> and a single point on the line <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>.
		</p>

		<exploration>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Find the equation for a line through the points <m>(1,3)</m> and <m>(3,2)</m>, and draw a graph of this line.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
				You are asked to find the <em>equation</em> of the line described.
				That means to find a rule defining the function as <m>y = f(x)</m>
			</p>
			<p>
				First, write down the point-slope definition of the line.  
				<me>
				y = {\color{green} m} (x - { \color{green} x_1}) + {\color{green} y_1}
				</me>
				You must find numbers for <m>m</m>, for <m>x_1</m>, and for <m>y_1</m>.
				In the problem, the first point <m>(1,3)</m> corresponds to <m>x_1=1</m> and <m>y_1=3</m>.  You could also use the second point <m>(3,2)</m>, which would correspond to the point <m>x_2=3</m> and <m>y_2 = 2</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the slope, use the formula 
				<md>
				<mrow> m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \amp \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
				<mrow>  = \amp \dfrac{2-3}{3-1}</mrow>
				<mrow>  = \amp \dfrac {-1}{2} = - \dfrac{1}{2} = -0.5 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				Plugging this into the point slope form, <m>y = {\color{green} m} (x - { \color{green} x_1}) + {\color{green} y_1}</m>, you get the <em>point slope form</em>
				<me>
				y = {\color{green} -0.5} (x - { \color{green} 1}) + {\color{green} 3}
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are instead asked for the <em>slope-intercept form</em> <m>y=mx+b</m>, you just need to simplify the equation you found above

			Linear functions arise whenever you have a <em>constant rate of change</em>.  
			We will examine rates in detail beginning in <xref ref="ch_totalschanges"/>. 
			For now, a few examples will suffice.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Velocity is a rate measured in <em>miles <alert>per hour</alert> </em>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Item Price is a rate measured in <em>dollars <alert>per item</alert></em>. 
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<exploration>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose that you are driving down a state highway at a constant speed with a broken spedometer.  
					At 3:00am, you drive by mile marker 5.  
					Later, at 5:30 am, you drive by mile marker 152.5. 
				</p> 
				<p>
					Find an equation for your position (mile marker) as a function of the number of <em>hours</em> since midnight.  
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
				Because we are asked to find the <em>equation</em> for a line, we first write down the point-slope form <me>  y = {\color{green} m} (x - { \color{green} x_1}) + {\color{green} y_1} </me>.  To fill in the missing information (the red variables), we must find the slope <m>m</m>, and a point <m>x_1</m> and <m>y_1</m>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				First, we must convert the information we are given into two points <m>(x,y)</m> where <m>x</m> is a number of hours since midnight, and <m>y</m> is a mile marker. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Because 3:00 am is three hours after midnight, the first piece of information corresponds to the point <m>x_1 = 3</m> hours and <m>y_1=5</m> miles.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second point is more tricky.  5:30 am is five <em>and a half</em> hours after midnight, so this corresponds to the point <m>x_2=5.5</m> and <m>y_2 = 152.5</m>
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the slope of the line, we can now use the formula 
				<md>
				<mrow> m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \amp \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
				<mrow> = \amp \dfrac{152.5-5}{5.5-3}</mrow>
				<mrow>=  \amp \dfrac {147.5}{2.5} = 59 </mrow>
				</md>
				In other words, our average velocity is 59 miles per hour.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the <em>linear equation</em> for our location, we now plug
				<m>m=59</m>,
				<m>x_1 = 3</m>, and 
				<m>y_1 = 5</m> into our equation for point-slope form to get 
				<me>
				y = {\color{green} 59} (x - { \color{green} 3}) + {\color{green} 5}
				</me>

			We want to use mathematics to study questions in economics and business.  
			To do this, we first need to introduce the key ideas between each of these economics concepts, and then apply mathematical tools to study them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In the sections that follow, each <c>Application</c> will introduce the concept from a more intuitive and economic perspective, and will connect these applications to the mathematical tools we have in this course.
			We will then <em>summarize</em> this connection, often with a mathematical <c>Definition</c>.

			<title>Item Price, Scenarios, and Possible Universes</title>
			<p>
			In life, and particularly in business, you need to make specific, concrete decisions.  
			You either hire a new employee or you don't.  
			You take out a loan of one amount, rather than another. 
			
			</p>

			<p>
			Sometimes, you ask yourself <em>what would happen if I make this decision?</em>   
			Or, once it's too late, you might ask yourself <em>what would have happened if I made that decision?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
			When comparing mutually exclusive choices, people often use words like <term>scenario</term> or <term>possible universe</term> to identify the different possible options. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There are many ways of trying to decide the price at which you will sell an item.  
			In an auction, buyers each decide the maximum price at which they will buy the item, and the individual who has largest maximum price wins the auction. 
			In a going-out-of-business sale, the company starts with high prices, and progressively lowers the price until everything in the store is sold. 
			Each individual has a different maximum price at which they will purchase the item.  The lower the price goes, the more items are sold. 
			</p>

			<p>
			<alert>In this class</alert> we always assume a company picks a <em>single item price</em>, and everyone pays that single price.  
			</p>
			<p>
			We also assume that you can change the price from day to day, holding all other things equal.  That means that fewer items will be sold on a day when the price is high, and more items will be sold on a day when the price is low.
		</p>
		</insight>

		<p>
			We will  focus on how changing the the number of items to be sold impacts the revenue, cost, and profitibility of a business.  
			Because of that, we will generally think of the <em>item price <m>p</m></em>  as a function of the <em>number of items <m>x</m></em>.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-demand">
			<statement>

				The <term>demand price</term> function is an equation <m>p = f(x)</m>. 
				Given a number of items <m>x</m> that you wish to sell, this function tells you the price <m>p</m> that will result in exactly <m>x</m> items being sold.
			</p>

			<title>Supply Price</title>
			<p>
			In any economic transaction, the person selling a product and the person  buying a product have very different perspectives. 
			</p>    
			<p>
			We already talked about the <em>buyer's</em> perspective when we talked about the <em>demand</em> price.  We now want to think about the <em>seller's</em> perspective by studying the <em>supply</em> price.
			</p>
			<p>
			Any seller has a huge number of options available to them.   On any given day, and in any given market, they might decide to create a new product, to cancel an existing product, to go out of business completely, etc. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Furthermore, making one product takes up time and energy that could otherwise be used to create another product.  In other words, there are many tradeoffs.
			</p>
			<p>
			The <term>supply price</term> of a particular number of items refers to the item price that the seller must be able to earn in order to make it worth their time to create that number of items. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For example, you might only be willing to increase production to <m>x=100</m> items if you are sure that you would be able to sell each item for <m>p=15</m>$ each.  In this case, the supply price for 100 items is 15$.
			</p>
			<p>
			Note that a higher item price will encourage sellers to produce more.  That means that supply functions are always increasing. 
			</p>
		</insight>

		<definition xml:id="def-supply">
			<statement>
			<p>
				The <term>supply price</term> function is an equation <m>p = g(x)</m>. 
			Given a number of items <m>x</m>, this function tells you the minimum item price <m>p</m> that will result in a manufacturer being willing to produce <m>x</m> items.

			</p>      
			<p>
				From this problem, we are told the seller will supply the quantity <m>x_1=2</m> at an item price of <m>p_1 = 5</m>.  Furthermore, the seller will supply the quantity <m>x_2=10</m> at an item price of <m>p_2=7</m>.  We need to find the equation of the line between these points.

			<title>Equilibrium quantity and price</title>
			
			<p>
				Supply price and demand price capture the two sides of the market, the seller (supply) side and the buyer (demand) side.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Because supply price is an increasing function, and demand price is a decreasing function, there will often be a single point where the two curves intersect.  
			</p>
			<p>
				If the curves do not intersect, then the demand price is always lower than the supply price. 
				In other words, there is no quanitity at which the market  willing to pay the item price required by  the seller.  In other words, no items are sold in this case. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The price where this happens is called the <term>equilibrium point</term>, because at this quaintity, the supply price and demand price are equal (in equilibrium).

			<statement>
				<p>
				In a certain market, 5 units will be sold when the price is 10 $ per item, and 15 units will be sold when the price is 5 $ per item. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Furthermore, the manufacturer is willing to supply 2 items when the item price is 5 $ per item, and that they are willing to supply 10 items when the item price is 7 $ per item.

			</statement>	
			<answer>
			<p>The equilibrium price is <m>p=7.166\dots</m> $ per item , and the equilibrium quantity is <m>x=10.666\dots</m> items.  That means that the equilibrium <em>point</em> is approximately <m>(10.666,7.166)</m>.
			</p>
			</answer>
			<solution>
			<p>
				We have already found in <xref ref="eg_demandprice_1"/> above that the demand price function correspoinding to <m>(5,10)</m> and <m>(15,5)</m> is given by the equation 
				<me>
				p=-0.5x + 12.5
				</me>
				and found in <xref ref="exploration_supplyprice_1"/> that supply price function corresponding to <m>(2,5)</m> and <m>(10,7)</m> is given by 
				<me>
				p =  0.25x + 4.5
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, we know that the equilibrium occurs at the intersection of these lines, which is the point at which the price from both of these equations is equal.  
			</p>
			<p>
				But if the price <m>p</m> in both equations is equal, that means that we can set the right hand sides to be equal, giving 
				<me>
				0.25x + 4.5 = -0.5x + 12.5
				</me>
				Now we just need to solve this equation for <m>x</m>
				<md>
				<mrow> 0.25x \amp+ 4.5\amp = \amp-0.5x \amp+ 12.5 </mrow>

			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, the equilibrium quantity is <m>x=10.666\dots</m>.
				To find the equilibrium price, plug this quanitity into either the supply or demand price functions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the supply price function, this gives
				<me>
				p = 0.25\cdot 10.666 + 4.5 = 7.166

				or equivalently using the demand price function gives

				</me>
				In either case, we get that the equilibrium price of <m>p=7.166\dots</m> $ per item corresponds to an equilibrium quantity of about <m>x=10.666\dots</m> items.  Putting it all together, we get that the equilibrium <em>point</em> is approximately <m>(10.666,7.166)</m>

					You are planning to manufacture a new plastic toy.

					Once you have purchased the mold, but before you have created the first toy, you have manufactured <m>x=0</m> items, but you have already spent <m>C(0)=100</m> dollars.  In other words, the cumulative cost of 0 items is 100$
				</p>
				<p>
					After you have manufactured <m>x=1</m> item, you have spent <m>C(1) = 100 + 5 = 101 </m> $.
				</p>
				<p>
					After you have manufactured <m>x=2</m> items, you have spent <m>C(2) = 100 + 5 + 5 =  100 + 5\cdot 2 =  110 </m> $.

					Looking at the pattern in these equations, you can "see" the equation for the total cost  function.  For any number of items <m>x</m>, the total cost will be

			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
					What is the fixed cost? What is the variable cost?
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Remember that in the graph above, we are given the <em>cumulative</em> (or total) cost <m>C</m> on the left, and the <em>item</em> cost <m>\Delta C</m> on the right.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Using the graph of <m>C(x)</m> on the left, we can see that the cumulative (total) cost of 0 items is $1, the total cost of 1 item is $3, the total cost of 2 items is 5, and so on. 
					</p>
					<p>
						First, this means that we have a <em>fixed cost</em> of $1.  Second, this suggests that each additional item increases the cost by $2.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The graph on the right tells us the variable cost for each item.  As expected, the cost increases by 2$ for each item, so the <em>variable cost</em> is equal to 2.
					</p>

				</solution>
			</task>
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Write down a formula for total cost <m>C</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Our strategy is to think through the meaning of the total cost as in <xref ref="explore_totalcost1"/>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have already found above that the fixed cost is <m>1</m>, and the variable cost is <m>2</m>.  Therefore, the total cost is equal to 
						<me>
							C(x) = 1 + 2x
						</me>
						And indeed this matches exactly the line you would get by connecting every dot in the graph on the left.  
					</p>
				</solution>
			</task>
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
					Write down a formula for change in cost <m>\Delta C</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Recall that <m>\Delta C</m> is the graph on the right, which tells us the item cost.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at the graph, we see that each item contributes the same amount to the total cost.  In other words, no matter which item <m>x</m> you are asking about, the <m>\Delta C</m> that item contributes will always be <m>2</m>.  
						In other words, <m>\Delta C</m> is the constant function 
						<me>
							\Delta C(x) = 2
						</me>
						And indeed connecting the dots in the graph on the right would indeed result in the line <m>y=2</m>.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</task>
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
					Explain how <m>\Delta C</m> relates to the formula for <m>C(x)</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						In this example, <m>\Delta C</m> is the <em>slope</em> of the line <m>y=C(x)</m>.  
					</p>
					<p>
						This will always be the case when the total cost function is <em>linear</em>, and the increment <m>\Delta x</m> is equal to 1. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The goal of calculus is to give a more complete connection between graphs of totals and changes for non-linear functions, and for situations where you are looking at changes with a different value of <m>\Delta x</m>.
					</p>
				</solution>

		<p>
			Most total cost functions in this class will be given as word problems.  But remembering the meaning of total and change graphs will often make it easier to interpret the different parts of the question correctly.

					<p>
						Because the <em>cost per item</em> is constant, the <em>total cost</em> function is linear.

					<p>
						We must therefore use the point slope form of the line 
						<me>
							C(x) = m (x-x_1) + y_1	
						</me>
						The knowledge that no (<m>0</m>) items corresponds to a cost of <m>5</m> dollars tells us that the point <m>x_1=0</m> and <m>y_1=5</m> is on our line.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are also told that <m>x_2=4</m> items corresponds to a price of <m>y_2=9</m> dollars, giving us the second point on our line. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To find <m>m</m>, use the slope formula <m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} = \dfrac{9-5}{4-0}=\dfrac{4}{4}=1</m>
					</p>
					<p>
						In other words, the slope is <m>m=\dfrac{1 \text{ \$}}{1\text{ item}}</m>, or 1 $ per item.
					</p>
					<p>
						Putting it all together, we get the equation

				Suppose that you are looking at a function of linear cost.  Can you come up with a formula if you are given only a <m>C(x)</m> graph? Why or why not? What if you are given only a <m>\Delta C</m> graph? Why or why not?
			</p>
		</aside>


		<paragraphs xml:id="more-realistic-cost-functions">
			<title>More Realistic Cost Functions are Not Linear</title>

			<p>
				In the examples above, the change in cost, <m>\Delta C</m>, of producing each additional item has been constant. In other words, in the examples above, creating an additional unit always costs the same amount. When this is the case, the total cost function <m>C(x)</m> will be a linear function.
			</p>

			<p>
				But life is often more complicated. Sometimes, you can get a bulk discount - if you manufacture enough items, the cost per item can come down. Other times, when there is only a limited amount of your raw materials, the item cost can increase as you produce more and more items. Often, you'll run into a more complex combination of these features. 
			</p>	
			<p>
				In the remainder of the course, we will use the study of rates of change for nonlinear functions that capture these kinds of economic dynamics. But to give a more complete picture, we will close this section with two examples of non-linear cost functions.

			<title>Think Economically with Units</title>

			<p>
				Suppose that you are planning to publish a new book, and you know from experience that it will cost $20,000 to edit and market the book, and $5 to print each individual copy of the book.
			</p>

			<p>
				These two costs are very different. The $20,000 is a single cost that applies regardless of the number of books. To highlight this, we call this the <term>fixed cost</term>, and measure this in <term>dollars</term> ($). On the other hand, the $5 cost applies to each item, so we call this the <term>variable cost</term>, and measure this in <term>dollars per item</term> or <m>\frac{\$}{\text{item}}</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose that we wish to purchase 1,000 books. Then the total cost is <m>20,000 + 5\cdot 1,000 = 25,000</m>. But there is actually something quite important going on here behind the scene. Here, each book is a separate item, so the units of the 1000 is going to be in <term>items</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				By using the letter <m>x</m> for the number of items, we get an equation that helps us think about the <term>total cost</term> of creating any number of books.
			</p>

			<p>
				Units of measure gives an easy trick for identifying the parts of the total cost function:
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				The fixed cost will be in $.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The variable cost will be in <m>\dfrac{\$}{\text{item}}</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Use the variable <m>x</m> for the number of items.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>

			<p>
				Units also help us make sense of equations once we've set them up. You can generally think of <q>units of measure</q> like variables, which means you can use algebra to interpret any equation. <me>\begin{aligned}
					\text{Total Cost} \quad = \quad \$ 
					&amp;\quad =\quad 
					\big(\$\big)\quad +\quad \left( \text{item}\cdot\dfrac{\$}{\text{item}}\right)
					\\
					&amp;\quad =\quad 
					\big(\$\big)\quad +\quad \left(  {\color{red}\text{item}}\cdot\dfrac{\$}{{\color{red}\text{item}}}\right) 
					\\
					&amp;\quad =\quad 
					\$\quad + \quad \$
					\\ 
					&amp;\quad =\quad
					\$\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that you can <em>only</em> <term>combine like terms</term>. If you ever find yourself trying to add <term>number items</term> to <term>dollars</term>, then you know that there is a problem!
			</p>

			<p>
				We can also use this idea to come up with a <term>function</term> for the cost of different numbers of books
			</p>

			<table>
				<title></title>
				<tabular>
				<row >
					<cell halign="center">items</cell>
					<cell halign="center">total cost <m>C</m></cell>
				</row>

				For this reason, we often write the total cost function <me>C(x) = 20000 + 1000\cdot x</me>

		<title>Models and Applied Domains</title>
		
		<p>
			In mathematics, functions are often defined by rules, and the  <em>domain</em> of a function is usually set of all the inputs where the rule can be applied.  For example, if <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, then I can apply the rule to any number <em>except</em> zero, because <m>\frac{1}{0}</m> is <em>undefined</em> (or <m>DNE</m>). 
			This was discussed in greater detail in <xref ref="sec-function-concepts"/> in general, and <xref ref="ex-finddomainfromrule"/> in particular.
 		</p>
		<p>
			But some functions are intended to <m>model</m> realistic phenomena, such as price, quanitity, and so on.  These realistic models impose additional constraints on when a model should be defined.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-applied_domain">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> is some function intended to <em>model</em> some application, phenomena, etc. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The <term>applied domain</term> of the function is the set of inputs where the function is both defined <em>and</em> where all of the quanitites involved make real, practical sense. 
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		
		<p>
			In this class, we will focus on price functions, and on two specific restrictions.  
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						The quantity cannot be negative.  That is, in the implied domain of a price function, we must have <m>x\geq 0</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The price cannot be negative.  That is, for <m>x</m> to be in the implied domain of a price function, we must have <m>p(x) \geq 0</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>  
		</p>
		
		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose that 
					<m>
						p(x) = -0.1x + 21
					</m> 
					defines an item price function.
					Find the applied (or implied) domain of <m>p(x)</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The <em>implied domain</em> of a function is the set of imputs where its <em>applied meaning</em> makes sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of item price, it doesn't make sense to look at the price of a negative number of items, and it doesn't make sense to talk about items with a negative prices.  That means that the implied domain of price is the set of <m>x</m> where <m>x\geq 0</m> and <m>p\geq 0</m>
				</p>
				<p>
					But we can rewrite the equation <m>p\geq 0</m> as follows:
					<md>
						<mrow>p(x) \geq 0 </mrow>
						<mrow>-0.1x + 21 \geq 0</mrow>
						<mrow>21 \geq 0.1x</mrow>
						<mrow>210 \geq x</mrow>
					</md>
					So the item price function makes sense when <m>0\leq x</m> and <m>x\leq 210</m>.  In other words, the applied domain is the interval <m>[0,210]</m>
				</p>
			</solution>
