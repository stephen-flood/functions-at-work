    <title>Function Concepts</title>
      

    <p>
      In this section, we will briefly review some key function concepts.  However, our main focus will be on beginning to connect these mathematical ideas to the central 
      economic and business concepts, applications, and examples that we will study over the course of this semester.
    </p>


    <exploration xml:id="ex-totalcost1">
      <introduction>
        <p>
        If you are manufacturing t-shirts, then the <em>total cost</em> will be a function  of the number of items you make.
        This is because there will be a rule which, 
          given  of the number of items to be made (the input)
          tells you a unique total cost in $ (the output).
        </p>

        <p>
          If <m>x</m> represents the number of items, we often write <m>C(x)</m> to denote the total cost of these <m>x</m> items. 
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Write the mathematical expression that says "the cumulative cost of making 97 items costs $350.42"
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            <m>C(97) = 350.42</m>
          </p>
        </answer>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Translate the statment <m>C(52) = 253.19</m> into natural language.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This statement says that the cumulative cost of making 52 items is $253.19.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Write a mathematical expression that describes the cost of items 53-97 <em>only</em>.  Use the information from the previous parts to find the cost of these items. 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We have seen already that <m>C(97)</m> tells us the cost of items 0-97, and that <m>C(52)</m> tells us the cost of items 0-52. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To find the cost of <em>only</em> items 53-97, we must subtract the cost of items 0-52 from the cost of items 0-97.
            Mathematically, this is written
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{Cost of items 53-97} \amp = C(97) - C(52) </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 350.42 - 253.19</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 97.23</mrow>
            </md>
            The total cost of items 53-97 is $97.23.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      Functions are important because they give us a single language that can describe an enormous number of different situations.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The next example uses the same language of functions to describe the very different situation of a very simple investment.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example_function_notation_and_investment">
      <title>Function notation and a simple investment.</title>
      <p>
        You begin with $1000 in a safe, and add $365 each year, spread out evenly over the year.
        Furthermore, you commit to keeping this up for ten years.   
        You want to study the value in the safe as a function of time.  
      </p>
      <p>
        To allow the amount of time to vary, we introduce an independent variable.  
        Often, we use <m>x</m> for the independent variable, which in this case is time. 
        We also often use <m>y</m> for the dependent variable, which in this case is the amount saved. 
        Although <m>x,y</m> are common variables, we could also have chosen other letters, such as <m>v</m> for value and <m>t</m> for time. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Putting this together, we get
      <me>
        y = f(x) = 1000 + 365 x \text{ for }x\text{ in } [0,10]
      </me>
        Reading from left to right, this says that the output balance <m>y</m> in $ is equal to a function of the input time <m>x</m>, and that we will use the letter <m>f</m> to refer this function. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It also says that this function is defined by a <em>rule</em>, which says to take the number of years <m>x</m>, to multiply that by 365, and then to add $1000.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, that sentence says that this rule applies only when the input <m>x</m> is in the closed interval <m>[0,10]</m>, which means that <m>x</m> can be any number in the interval <m>0\leq x\leq 10</m>.
        In other words, this rule specifies its <alert>domain</alert>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because our savings are spread out <em>evenly over the year</em>, we can find the value of our savings after <q>four and a half years</q>, as well as finding the value after three years exactly.
        In other words, the domain of our savings function contains decimals like <m>4.5</m> years, as well as whole numbers like <m>3</m> years. 
        This even will us to find the amount in the safe after <m>40</m> <alert>days</alert>.  Assuming that there are 365 days in a year, day <m>40</m> happens at <alert>year</alert> <m>x=\frac{40}{365}=0.1096</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <exploration xml:id="ex-savedaily">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Suppose that you  begin with $1000 in a safe, and add $365 each year for ten years, spread out evenly over the year.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Write the equation for the value in the safe as a function of time. 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This problem does not specify the variables that we should use for our function.  If <m>y</m> represents value and <m>x</m> represents time in years, then we have the same equation tjat that we found in <xref ref="example_function_notation_and_investment"/>. 
            <me>
              y = f(x) = 1000 + 365 x \text{ for }x\text{ in } [0,10]
            </me>
            If we instead used <m>v</m> for value and <m>t</m> for time, the equation would become
            <me>
              v = f(t) = 1000 + 365 t \text{ for }t\text{ in } [0,10]
            </me>
            We could also use any other variables we decided were most appropriate.

          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We are told that this rule only applies between year <m>x=0</m> and year <m>x=10</m>.  
            That means that we should start our graph at <m>(0,f(0))</m>, and end it at <m>(10,f(10))</m>.  
            In this case, the value is a linear function, so we can complete the graph by connecting these points.

            </m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To apply this rule, we must first convert 40 <alert>days</alert> to <em>years</em>.  In a standard calendar year, there are 365 days, so 1 day = 1/365 year.  So day 40 is just a little bit over 10% of a year.  More precisely, we can do a unit conversion as follows
            <md>
              <mrow> 40\text{ days } \amp = 40 \text{ days }\cdot \frac{1 \text{ year}}{365\text{ days}} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{40}{365} \frac{days\cdot year}{days}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \frac{40}{365} year</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 0.10958\dots year</mrow>
            </md>
            We can now plug this year into our value function
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{value on day 40} \amp = \text{value in year }0.10958 </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = f(0.10958) </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 1000 + 365\cdot 0.10958</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 1039.9967 </mrow>
            </md>
            After 40 days, the value will be approximately $1040.

              In <xref ref="ex-savedaily"/>, we are explicitly told that our savings function is not defined before year 0, and not defined after year 10.  
              In other words, we are explicitly told that the domain of that function is the interval <m>[0,10]</m>, or equivalently, the set <m>0\leq x \leq 10</m>

            Find the range of the savings function. 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The range of the savings function is the set of all values that will occur in the account.  
            The smallest value that will occur is $1000, and the largest value that will occur is $4,650.  That means that the <em>range</em> is the set of all numbers between those values.  In interval notation, this is <m>[1000,4650]</m>.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The question of the range in that example is more complex.  
            In words, a number will be in the range of our savings function if there is that amount in the safe at some year <m>x</m> between 0 and 10.  
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If you think about it, you'll never have a value of $900 in your account since it starts at $1000 and increases. 
            You'll also never have  $1,000,000 in your account, since you are only adding about a dollar a day for 10 years.  
            In other words, the numbers 900 and $1,000,000 are not in the range of our savings function. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the value $1000 will definitely be in the range because you start on the first day of the first year with <m>1000=f(0)</m> dollars in your account.
            And  $4,650 will be in the range because you end the 10th year with <m>4650=f(10)=1000+365\cdot 10</m> in your account.
            Finally, every value between 1000 and 4650 will also be in the range, because you are continuously adding money to the account.  
            But does that mean only the values for whole number years?  What about fractional years?   To answer that question, it helps to look at the graph of the savings function.

            In the graph of our function, we see that the value is added continuously (uniformly), so all <m>y</m> values between 1000 and 4650 can be achieved.  
            Thus, the domain is 
            <me>
              1000 \leq y \leq 4650
            </me>
            In interval notation, this is
            <me>
              [1000,4650]

    <p>
      The concept of domain is very important in mathematics.  For example, there is an important difference between a function defined using a table, and a function defined using a formula.  
      When you have a function defined using a table, the domain is restricted to the inputs given for all practical purposes.  
      But when you have a function defined using a formula, the domain includes every input where the function is defined.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In calculus, our goal will be to describe how <em>fast</em> the function <m>f</m> is changing, relative to a changine in the input <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
          In the example above, how fast does your <em>savings</em> go up every day? 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because we are adding $365 dollars every day, in a year with 365 days, that corresponds to a rate of <m>\frac{365\$/\text year}{365\text{ days per year}} = 1\frac{\$}{\text{day}}</m>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How fast does it go up every minute?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Because there are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour, there are <m>365\cdot 24\cdot 60=525,600</m> minutes in a year.  That means that a rate of one dollars per day  corresponds to a rate of <m>\frac{365\$\text{ per year}}{525,600\text{ minutes per year}}\approx 0.00069444444 \frac{\$}{\text{minute}}</m>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How fast does it go up every month? 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This question is quite difficult, perhaps impossible, to answer.  This is because there are different numbers of days per month. 
            One way to try to answer it is to divide the <m>365</m> dollars that is added in a year by <m>12</m> months per year to get <m>\frac{365}{12}=30.416\dots</m> $/month.  
            However, this is acually very misleading, since more money will be added in a longer month like July, and less money will be added in a shorter month like February.
            For the purposes of this course, we will always focus on more clearly defined questions, where the rate of change in the input (time) is uniform.

    Nothing is truly constant in economics, business, and life.
    Time and quantities change, and things like cost, revenue and profit change along with them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In terms of functions, we can say that changing the <em>input</em>  changes the <em>output</em>. 
    On a graph, that means that moving the input <m>x</m> left and right causes the output <m>y</m> to go up and down.

                The graphic shows the corresponding point on the graph and output <m>y</m> (height).

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Move the slider back and forth. 
                See how changing the input <m>x</m>-value left and right forces the height (<m>y</m>-value) to go up and down.

            Remember that the equation <m>f(x)=2</m> means that you are looking for the <em>inputs</em> <m>x</m> which correspond to an <em>output</em> of <m>2</m>.
            Looking at the graph, we see that <m>f(1)=2</m> and that <m>f(3)=2</m> and that <m>f(5)=2</m>.  That means that the solution set is <m>x=1\ or\ x=3\ or\ x=5</m>.

              Endpoints require special care. 
              In this case, there was a <em>filled in dot</em> at the point <m>(5,2)</m>, which means that <m>f(5)</m> is defined and equal to 2.  
              If there was an <em>open circle</em> at the point, then the function would be defined <em>near</em> <m>x=5</m>, but not <em>at</em> <m>x=5</m>.

            Similarly, solving the equation <m>f(x) = 3</m> means finding the inputs <m>x</m> that correspond to an output (height) <m>y</m> of 3.  
            Looking at the graph, we see that <m>f(1.5)=3</m> and <m>f(2.5)=3</m>.  That means that the solutions set is <m>x=1.5\ or\ x=2.5</m> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, solving <m>f(x) = 0</m> means finding the inputs <m>x</m> that have a height <m>y</m> of zero.  Looking at the graph, this happens only for <m>x=4</m>.

            Remember that the equation <m>f(x)\lt 2</m> means that you are looking for the <em>inputs</em> <m>x</m> which correspond to an output of <em>strictly less than</em> <m>2</m>.
            To understand this inequality, follow the graph of the function, moving through  <m>x</m>-values from left to right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above <m>x=0</m>, the height is <m>1</m> which is less than <m>2</m>. 
            Moving right, the height of the function increases, but stays below <m>2</m> until we reach <m>x=1</m>.  
            That means that the function is <em>less than</em> or <em>equal to</em> 2 on the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
            But because we want the height to be <em>strictly less than</em> 2, we must exclude 1, giving us the interval <m>[0,1)</m>.
          </p>              
          <p>
            Similarly, the height is also less than 2 between <m>x=3</m> and <m>x=5</m>, and equal to 2 at those endpoints, so the function is <em>strictly less than</em> 2 on the interval <m>(3,5)</m>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Putting it all together, we have that <m>f(x)\lt 2</m> on the set <m>[0,1)\bigcup (3,5)</m>, or equivalently when <m>0\leq x\lt 1\ or\ 3\lt x\lt 5</m>.

              The inequality <m>f(x)\gt 0</m> is true for all inputs that correspond to an output that is strictly greater than 0.  
              This is true for all values of <m>x</m> <em>except</em> <m>x=4</m>.

          <answer>
            <p>
              The domain of <m>f(x)</m> is the set of <m>x</m>-values where the function is defined.  In this example, the function is defined starting at <m>x=0</m> and stopping at <m>x=5</m>. Therefore the domain is <m>[0,5]</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The range of <m>f(x)</m> is the set of <m>y</m>-values that are output by the function.  Looking at the function, note that you can achieve outputs as small as <m>f(x)=0</m> (at <m>x=4</m>) and as large as <m>f(x)=4</m> (at <m>x=2</m>), as well as every output between those <m>y</m>-values.  
              Furthermore, no larger or smaller <m>y</m> can be achieved.  As a result, the range of the function is the interval <m>[0,4]</m>.
