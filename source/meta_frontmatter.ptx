    <title>How to use this book</title>
    <p>
      Welcome to Business Calculus.  
      You are beginning an exciting adventure into a new kind of mathematics, one with more applications than you have seen in your previous courses, and one which will require new kinds of practice and problem solving. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This book is the result of many years of teaching and refining this course, with a particular focus on highlighting a variety of ways that this course can be of service to you in your future studies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The large number of examples with full solutions are intended to aid you in your study of the topic.  
    </p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Promise of Active Reading</title>
      <p>
        In the online version of this book, the statement of a problem is shown, but the solution starts out hidden.  
        When you see a question like this, 
        <ol>
          <li>Think about the meaning of the question.  <em>What</em> do the terms used mean?  <em>Why</em> is this question being asked.  Go back to the previous definitions and explanations to refresh yourself.
          </li>
          <li>Try to answer the question yourself by hand, on a piece of paper.  Do you know <em>How</em> to start?  Do you get stuck at some point?</li>
          <li>Once you've been trying for a little bit, then look at the <em>Solution</em>.  Did you get the same answer?  What steps does the solution use?  Why does it use those steps? </li>
        </ol> 
      </p>
      <p>
        This might seem like a lot of extra work, since the solutions are already right there in the text, and you already have many other problems and assignments to get to.   
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          One practical resource is <url href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</url> by Brown et.al.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        In fact, spending time thinking and struggling is an important part of how humans learn.  This has been studied extensively in the theory of learning.  
        The importance of thinking for yourself has also been recognized by great thinkers over thousands of years.

      <title>The Danger of Passive Reading</title>
      <p>
        As Arthur Melzer writes in <em>Philosophy Betwen the Lines</em>, 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <q>A book is a strange and unseemly thing.  It delivers into one person's hands the distilled essence of another's thinking.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>
            The first danger of reading books is that it allows you to skip too many stages, shortcutting the proper intellectual development....
            Before you have had a chance to face the questions and live with them a while, you have seen the answers. 
            Books give a false sense of knowledge ... on the belief that you know what you have only read. 
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Philosophy Between the Lines</em>, page 211.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Melzer also quotes another author (Schopenhauer) who observes that 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <q>
            When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process.... So it comes that if anyone spends almost the whole day reading ... he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last forgets how to walk.
          </q>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>So reading is pointless?</p>
      <p>No: we learn quickly with listening and immitation.
          But we gain the best, most durable learning (like the knowledge you will need during a test)  
          by wrestling with questions and concepts ourselves.</p>

      <title>Course Overview</title>

      <p>
        Mathematical knowledge has been described as <em>synthetic</em>.
        This is both because we learn mathematics by doing, and because we must incorproate each new concept into a broader system of knowledge.
        <fn>
          Much more can be said about this, which gets into the broader foundations of mathematics.  You can read a little bit about this <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic%E2%80%93synthetic_distinction">online</url>.
        </fn> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mastery of <em>College Algebra</em>, or an equivalent class, is absolutely essential for success in this course, and <em> will be assumed throughout</em>.  
        If you would like a brief summary of selected formluas and ideas from algebra, see <xref ref="algebrareview"/>.
        If your algebraic skills are weaker, talk to your instructor to obtain resources for additional practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this course is to provide a first introduction to two related topics
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref ref="part-algebra"/> , we will discuss a range of applications of mathematics, including algebra, to economics and business contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the mathematical techniques in this section should be familiar, although the applications will not. 
              The main exception to this will be <xref first="ch_exponentials" last="ch_logarithms"/>, where we will introduce the mathematics of exponential and logarithmic functions in some detail. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <xref first="part-rates" last="part-integrals"/>, we will introduce and apply mathemtical techniques for studing change, rates, and area. 
              These tools will teach us a <em>method for calculation</em> of rates and areas, and are therefore often given the name <alert>calculus</alert>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      This book was written during a one semester sabbatical at Bridgewater State University during the Fall of 2022, and expanded during the following few semesters.  
      There may be a range of typographical errors, formatting issues, and so on.  
      If you believe that you have found a mistake, or if you have just found a place where the explanations can be improved or expanded, please contact the author at <email>sflood@bridgew.edu</email>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The material on graphs of totals and changes is based on previous work in collaboration with my colleague Karen Duseau, also of Bridgewater State University, and funded by a QuAC <em>Course Development Summer Grant</em>.
      I also learned the terminology of AROC and IROC tables from Karen Duseau.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the best of my knowledge, the other examples and exposition in this book are newly written, and are based on ideas in common use.  
      However, it is always possible that something from a textbook or other resource I have used in the past has been unintentionally incorporated in some form or another.  
      If you believe this may have happened, please contact the author at <email>sflood@bridgew.edu</email>, and I will happily correct the oversight.
